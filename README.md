### Overview
This project serves as a practical exploration of Spring Data JPA, focusing on the implementation and interaction between the service layer and repository layer. The aim is to understand how these layers work together to facilitate clean, manageable data access and business logic implementation in a Java application.

### Features
#### Service Layer: 
Encapsulates the business logic of the application, providing a clear separation from the data access code in the repository layer.
#### Repository Layer: 
Utilizes Spring Data JPA to define data access operations, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing maintainability.
#### Integration: 
Demonstrates how the service and repository layers interact to perform operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
